# obsidian-utils [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/@acgabbert%2Fobsidian-utils.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/@acgabbert%2Fobsidian-utils)
This is a library I've built for working with Obsidian's TypeScript API and Obsidian plugin development. 

This library is expected to change frequently. My future goal is to improve test coverage and get the code to a more stable state before releasing version 1.0.
